// TheStormAI initial story proposal:
"While [the] original idea was a 4-6 hour story campaign, thats probably not reasonable for a 2 week timeframe, but I also haven't fully written the story down yet. But I have written down the complete tutorial.

The game opens with a bit of exposition: Aliens are invading the planet, and to defeat them, our great nation (which is unnamed) has developed great technology - 3D printed robots and the ability to fuse nerves to wire. These robots can be remote-controlled long-distance by wiring your own nerves into a controller.
Youâ€™ve volunteered.
The surgery went well - you are ready to fight. And because you - your robots - are disposable, you are being sent to destroy an entire enemy regiment - alone.
After all, its just a 3D printed robot. Its disposable.
Your handler serves as your tutorial, and guiding voice/mission control for the game.
Since its your first time using your nerves to control a robot, you of course need a tutorial. your handler teaches you movement and combat.
I'm hoping it draws the player in so much that they don't notice that some of the enemies don't even try to attack - just run away. Your handler encorages you to finish them off - if even one gets away, they can repopulate and dig in even harder, making it increasingly difficult to win the war.

You finish them off and your handler begins to disconnect you from the drone. As you do, the screen glitches for a moment and for a split frame, the alien bodies appear human.

It would probably be a more basic art style like OXTO if you've played that game."
